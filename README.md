<h2 align="center">ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Jonas.</h2>
<p align="center">Iâ€™m a passionate web developer based in Belgium. My main focus is Javascript and React.</p>

- â˜€ I'm spending all my spare time for the time being on **CityRays** - the easiest way to find bars and restaurants with sunny terraces in Antwerp, Belgium. For the moment I'm trying to create a proof of concept together with [@YvesBos](https://github.com/YvesBos). Stay tuned for updates on our progress!
- ðŸ”­ My day job involves building sustainable digital solutions at [Rombit Studio](https://rombit.studio/) as a frontend developer on behalf of [Euricom](https://www.euri.com/)
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about **JavaScript, TypeScript and React**
- ðŸ¤“ In 2023 I'll be learning and/or improving my knowledge of JavaScript, testing web apps, Astro, Remix, Next.js, Node.js, TypeScript, React, tRPC, MongoDB, mobile apps (React Native) (Three.js and React Three Fiber if I find the time ðŸ˜…).
