<h2 align="center">ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Jonas.</h2>
<p align="center">Iâ€™m a passionate web developer based in Belgium. My main focus is Javascript and React.</p>

- â˜€ Currently working on **CityRays &trade;** - the easiest way to find sunny spots in Antwerp, Belgium. For the moment I'm trying to create a proof of concept. At least for now, I'm doing this in a private repository. I look forward to share more in a later stage.
- ðŸ”­ My day job involves building sustainable digital solutions at [Rombit Studio](https://rombit.studio/) as a frontend developer on behalf of [Euricom](https://www.euri.com/)
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about **JavaScript, TypeScript and React**
